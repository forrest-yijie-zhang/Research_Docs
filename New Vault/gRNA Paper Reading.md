### 1.  Design nonrepetitive and diverse activity single-guide RNA by deep learning
1. Methods
	1. Transformer-based unsupervised generative model
		1. Most existing approaches are relied on supervised learning
		2. Lack of data
		3. Learn the sample distribution
		4. Database: over 40000 CRIPR_related RNA sequences
		5. Autoregressive training: probability of the occurrence of the next base in the sequence solely depends on the preceding nucleotide
		6. Adding secondary structures to it
### 2. Machine learning methods for predicting guide RNA effects in CRISPR epigenome editing experiments
1. Methods
	1. Existing methods are using genetic data rather than epigenetic perturbation experiments
	2. Used CNN and XGBoost to interpret input features
### 3. CRISPR-GPT: An LLM Agent for Automated Design of Gene-Editing Experiments 
1. Methods
	1. Human Evaluation included
### 4.
